# NoSecureLyte

A very broken and W.I.P. Node.JS web proxy made for unblocking websites, works with google search and not much else. Has a "working" custom frontend, configurable port (with an option for a random one), and configurable prefix (with an option for no/different prefix types in future.), captchas DO load but will need to be fixed to get them to work

## Features
- Working Google search
- Dark theme
- Works well as a basic web scraper or web searcher.

## Future plans

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Live previews for iframes on new page
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform support
- Panic button
- Custom JS injection (*wink*)
- The holy trinity of HTML, CSS, and JS rewriting
- FULL captcha support (ehhhh idk)
- FULL Youtube support (idk bout this one)
